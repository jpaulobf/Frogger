## Getting Started

Welcome to my space, here in GitHub.
I'm developing games with my new Java 2D Modern Engine.
100% pure Java software.

This is my reinvenction of the famous Konami's game, Frogger.
Feel free to try it!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

In `lib` folder, you have access to an JAR containing 3 .dll: `jinput-dx8_64.dll`, `jinput-raw_64.dll` & `jinput-wintab.dll`.
They are all optional, but, if you want to use a Joystick with the game, you'll have to copy this .dll into your System32 folder.
This `lib` was provided by the JInput author, and you can directly download from here: https://jinput.github.io/jinput/

Feel free to report me your feedback in my personal e-mail: master.eljo@gmail.com
